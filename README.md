# Quotes API

Create a Node.js API that allows for the creation and retrieval of quotes.

A quote example: 

"Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute."
â€• Harold Abelson, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

Each quote may have an author or not, but definitely contains some text.

Implement all related CRUD operations:

* adding a quote to the DB
* getting quote by id
* getting a list of all quotes
* updating a quote
* delete a quote by id

Implement a script to seed the DB initially with a good amount of data.

## Additional tasks

### Random quote

Implement an endpoint that returns every time a random quote.

### Categories

Each quote can be categorized.

Implement all related CRUD operations.

Update the script thats seeds the DB initially.

### Random quote in a category

### Votes

### Most voted quote

### Most voted quote by category
